        i.e. Microsoft.AspNetCore.App for .NET Core 2.1 
        and Microsoft.AspNetCore.All for .NET Core 2.0
3) In Net Core, Web Application is actually a Console App underneath
    a) Just Go to Program.cs Comment Line below and add you code and 
        Try running the app it works 
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // IT Works
            Console.WriteLine("Let's Check");        
            //CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }    
    b) Some Libary which are related to AspNetCore are listed below(Found in Program.cs)
        1) Microsoft.AspNetCore
        2) Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting

5)  This StartUp Type Class need some method listed below to start the Web Application
    a) ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services);       
        The Above method is use to add Services in service container
        let say we want to use service like MVC then we can say services.AddMvc();
        services.AddAuthentication(); and may more etc.         
    b) Configure(IApplicationBuilder app,IHostingEnvironment env);
        The Above method is use to Use those services which are added in ConfigureServices  
        Let say we have added services.AddMvc() then in Configure we will be using 
        app.UseMvc();
        We can also add some Interface which we then can use Just like IHostingEnviroment or ILoggerFactory
        The Above method is also used to configure Http Request PipeLine
    [
        Note : ConfigureServices : Load all the services required i.e. Add
               Configure : Use those services i.e. Use
    ]
