1) If TempData attribute is decorated on the Property. It signifies that this properties belongs to PageModel not Database.
2) As we have added TempData Property inside the MyPageModel we can now access those property whereever we have inherited 
	MyPageModel Class i.e. In Razor Page and also Code Behind.
3) I tried jquery to fadeIn to remove the message after 5 Second but it didn't work.
4) We need to add jQuery in the @section Scripts to make it work as shown below
	@seciton Scripts {
		<script type="text/javascript">	
			jQuery("document").ready(function(e){
				$(".alert-info").delay(5000).fadeIn('slow');
			});
		</script>
	}
5) END,...
