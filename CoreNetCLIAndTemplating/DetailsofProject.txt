Dotnet can be installed on Windows, MAC, Linux (different vendor) & Docker(I don't knwo what a docker is)
1) dotnet sdk and runtime can be downloaded from www.dotnet.com    
2) After installation we can start development
3) Some command to check and help you for development
    a) dotnet -> check whether dotnet is installed on your machine
    b) dotnet --v -> which version of dotnet is installed
    c) dotnet --h -> it provide help on dotnet level
    d) dotnet new --h -> it provide help on dotnet new level 
    e) dotnet new console --h -> it provide help on dotnet new console level
GO TRY IT 
4) Creating a APP using command line
	a) dotnet new console 
	b) The command will create a new console application
	c) it will also restore the packages and dependencies 
	d) In pervious versions we had to run dotnet restore the above process to happen
	e) In dotnet 2.0+, this feature has been added
		(At the time of creating a appplication, packages dependencies are restored automatically)
	f) To run the application we use the below command 
		dotnet run
	g) While running this command for the first time on newly created application 
	   We will observer some delay as it will be first compile and build
	h) Next run it will take less time to run the application
	i) If you want to run this application in vs code, Use Command "Code ."
	j) Click on Yes as vs code will need to add some file to debug the application(No Need to Touch does files)
	k) I noticed that in my version of vs code(1.26.1) Step j was not prompted.
	l) I had to update my vs code(1.27.1) and then go to debugger option -> 
		Add Configuration ->  .Net Core 
	m) Then it prompted me Step J 
5) To run the application in the vs code, 
	we need to use Terminal i.e Ctrl + ~ (Tilda Sign)
6) For debugging the Application -> Go to Debugging Sign on the left 
	-> Click on Green Play button -> VOLA we can debug the application in VS code
7) Go to Launch.json in .vscode edit the name attribute "ToAnyThing" 
	Now go to Debugging Option, you will be able to see "ToAnyThing" in drop down
	i.e. we can also change this names (I don't known I saw scott doing it I did it.)
8) Go to code.visualstudio.com for extension and all BRO
